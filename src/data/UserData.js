  about: `Hi, I'm Rafiq â€” a Full-Stack Developer and AI Engineer passionate about building innovative, scalable solutions that make a difference.

I architect and develop high-performance applications using modern tech stacks: React.js/Next.js for web, React Native for mobile, and Node.js/Python for robust backend services. My expertise extends to building real-time features and implementing complex database solutions with both SQL and NoSQL technologies.

What sets me apart is my deep experience in AI/ML technologies. I specialize in developing intelligent systems using OpenAI, Google's Gemini, and custom LLM architectures. I've successfully implemented RAG systems, AI agents, and NLP solutions that enhance user experiences and automate complex workflows.

Whether it's crafting cloud-based SaaS products, building AI-powered applications, or mentoring fellow developers, I bring a blend of technical expertise and innovative problem-solving to every project. I'm committed to writing clean, efficient code that scales and maintaining high standards through modern DevOps practices.`,
