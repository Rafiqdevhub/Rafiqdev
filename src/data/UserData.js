  about: `Hi, I'm Rafiq â€” a full-stack developer with a unique blend of technical expertise and HR experience.

I specialize in building scalable web and mobile apps, integrating AI/ML to create smart, user-driven solutions.

From hotel management systems and university chatbots to AI-powered recruitment agents, I love turning complex ideas into working products using tools like React, Next.js, Express.js, FastAPI, MongoDB, and OpenSearch.

With a background in HR and tech recruitment, I bring a rare understanding of both code and people making me especially effective in building systems that support teams, hiring, and productivity.`,
